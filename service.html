    <h1>EYELASHES</h1>
    <p>Like every part of the body, eyes, eyelashes, need hygiene.
        It's like if we don't wash our heads because the hair dye will run.
        Eyelashes secrete sebum and yes, they are washed, any make-up residue or other products that can lead to SERIOUS consequences are removed.
        
        Women who turn to eyelash extensions do so not only to have more beautiful eyelashes, but also to simplify their daily make-up routine. If you have eyelash extensions, you no longer need to apply mascara every day. Moreover, because the extensions contour your upper eyelid very well, you can even give up eyeliner or eye make-up.
        
        Despite the myths, make-up artists assure us that extensions do not affect our eyelashes, if they are applied and cared for correctly.
        
        Why do women give up mascara?
        
        Although the application of eyelash extensions takes longer, they last even several months. In addition, if they are applied correctly and are not too long, they can look very natural. Some women also think about the sensitive skin around the eyes when opting for extensions: unlike mascara, you don't have to scrub your eyes with makeup remover every day to get rid of them.
        
        "People are willing to invest more to have eyelash extensions because it makes the morning routine easier,"
        
        
        THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXTENSIONS
        This variety is especially used for correcting or balancing traits. Thus, there are different procedures for deep-set, upturned or asymmetrical eyes. Through the correct application of eyelash extensions, it is possible to create an effect of visually enlarging or elongating the eyes. And for mature people, it can give them a revitalizing, lifting look by raising the facial expression.
        
        There are dozens of different types of lashes, with more natural or more dramatic final looks. They differ according to: length, thickness, color, curvature, gloss.
